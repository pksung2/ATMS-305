# ATMS 305 Spring 2017 Homework 2  v1.0
## Due: 6 February 2017, 9:30 AM
Copy your final scripts, and the output of the scripts commands in a folder called `/data/atms305/a/netID/ATMS-305/Week3Answers`.  The output can be saved in a file `Week3Answers.txt` in that directory.  Note each output with a header and footer, such as
```

OUTPUT FROM PROBLEM 2

# Problems:
## 1. Command line arguments
Create a `bash` script that prints out each of the command line arguments passed to it, and the number of arguments.

## 2. Command substitution and Dates
Create a `bash` script which will take a filename as its first argument and create a Universal Time Coordinate (UTC) dated copy of the file. eg. if our file was named `file1.txt` it would create a copy such as `2017-01-30_22:45:00_file1.txt`, where the date and time are determined *automatically*. (To achieve this you will probably want to play with command substitution and the command `date`)
